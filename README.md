### 1. Introduction
The Balloon Game is a simple JAVA implementation of a quite popular Bubble Hit game using native Swing components only. The game is all about matching the bullet with a group of two or more balloons of the same color. The goal of this game is to either remove all balloons from the map (level mode) or to score a maximum amount of points possible (arcade mode).

### 2. How to run
* Install [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/) from the Oracle website.
* Clone the project and enter the executable directory.
* Run the .jar file. 

### 3. Game modes
The game has two modes:
* Level mode - player has to remove all balloons from the map. When there are no balloons left, a new map is loaded. The game ends when there are no more maps to be loaded.
* Arcade mode - the aim is to achieve the highest score possible. The points are earned by removing balloons from the map. The game ends when the balloons descends to the same level as the bullet.

It is also possible to set the difficulty of the game. The higher difficulty is set, the more balloon colors are displayed.
