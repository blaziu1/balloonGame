### 1. Introduction
The Balloon Game is a simple JAVA implementation of a quite popular Bubble Hit game using native Swing components only. The game is all about matching the bullet with a group of two or more balloons of the same color. The goal of this game is to either remove all balloons from the map (level mode) or to score a maximum amount of points possible (arcade mode).
